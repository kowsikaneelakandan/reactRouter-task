            <h2>What is full stack development?</h2>
            <p>Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.</p>

          <spam>Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both disciplinesâ€”meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base.</spam>
          <h2>What are the technologies used in full-stack development?</h2>
          <p>The technologies that a full-stack developer uses will change depending on the focus area. Below are the <u>differences between frontend and backend technologies.</u></p>
          <b>Frontend technology</b>
          <p>Frontend technology (or client software) focuses on the client-facing side of development. You code any parts of the graphical user interface (GUI) or the features that users interact with using frontend technology.</p>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <b>Backend technology</b>
          <p>Backend technology (or server software) coordinates the exchange of information between the frontend and the server running a webpage. It allows an application to communicate with the main server. The most common backend languages are Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Ruby, Java, and Python. However, there are many more programming languages and technologies that can be used for different requirements. </p>
