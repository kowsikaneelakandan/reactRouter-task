        <h2>Best practices for cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>Adopting best practices for cybersecurity can significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks. 
          Here are three key practices:</p>
        <ul><li><b>Regular software and operating system updates</b></li>
        <p>Updating software and operating systems regularly helps to patch vulnerabilities and enhance security measures against potential threats.</p>
        <li><b>Using strong and unique passwords</b></li>
        <p>Creating strong and unique passwords for each online account can enhance cybersecurity, as cyberattacks often exploit weak or stolen passwords.</p>
        <li><b>Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)</b></li>
        <p>Multi-factor authentication involves multiple identification forms before account access, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. <u>Cisco Duo includes MFA</u> that can integrate with most major applications as well as custom apps.</p>
        </ul>
        Following these practices enhances cybersecurity and protects digital assets. It's vital to stay vigilant and informed about the latest threats and security measures to stay ahead of cybercriminals.
